Summary: 
	We were provided some files and we had to make it either work with MongoDB or 
	Stanley's server to post our coffee orders and then while it's activated on each 
	of our web browsers, you can click on any of the orders into the dropdown checkbox
	and it will get rid of the order and mark it as served.  This project was for us
	to get familiar with AJAX and incorporating async operations integrated with REST
	services.  REST events are fired when an order is placed and is added to the 		orders list in JSON format.  


NOTE: 
	-please make sure that each email that's entered is entered with @bignerdranch.com
